Noise Proctor! sounds fancy? actually its not. Its a simple application that detects real time audio and if the sound exceeds the set threshold, flags it as noise and asks you to "Keep it down!".

The festive season comes with firecrackers🧨 and booming music📢,  basically ultimate stress for elders, infants, and pets. Will this application stop it? Well, no. This application works as a detector helping people stay mindful and responsible during the festive season.

This Diwali and Christmas, may the air be filled with chatter and laughter 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 and even if the app nudges you to keep it down, don't bother!
